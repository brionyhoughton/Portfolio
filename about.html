            <p>After achieving a BTEC qualification in Engineering I was in a position to progress my career, so I made
                the decision to focus my career in the Software area. My aspirations are to utilise the skills I have in
                order to fulfil a rewarding career that I am passionate about. I am currently studying at a Code Nation in Chester.</p>
             <div class="about2">
              <p>During this course I have front-end experience using Javascript, html and css. Using these skills practically I have produced games, websites and applications from scratch on Visual Studio Code, also using Git. Worked with various frameworks and libraries, such as React enabled us to efficiently reuse components within team project. Whilst working on various projects I have gained back-end experience using Express.js and Node.js working with API's.
