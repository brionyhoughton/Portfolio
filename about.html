        <div class="about">
            <p>After achieving a BTEC qualification in Engineering I was in a position to progress my career, so I made
                the decision to focus my career in the Software area. An influence on this decision was my success
                within the IT sections of the course I completed. My aspirations are to utilise the skills I have in
                order to fulfil a rewarding career that I am passionate about. I am currently studying at a coding boot
                camp in Chester. I have developed skills and experience with Javascript, HTML, Css, Node.js and also
                worked with various frameworks and libraries such as React. </p>
